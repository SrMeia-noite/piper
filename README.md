# The piper class
The piper class is a wrapper class to facilitate the implementation of 'pipeable' functions (a.k.a. `fn1 | fn2`, "Pass the output of 'fn1' to 'fn2'").

To implement your own pipeable functions, is a very easy process, just:
```python
from pipe import pipe
```

Then decorate your function with it `@pipe`:
```python
@pipe
def my_fun(...):
    ...
```
The only rule here is that the first argument will be the input of the pipe, such as:
```python
1 | fn == fn(1)
```
You  may recognize this pattern, because it is the exact same thing as a class calling a method, which it's first argument is `self` (`method(self) == self.method()`).

Now, if you still not sure how to use it, let's implement a simple sum function to add all elements of a list, the implementation is as it follows:
```python
def sum(elements):
    result = 0
	
	for element in elements:
	    result += element
		
	return result
```
Do you see how simple the implementation is? It is just a common sum function, like everybody would implement. The catch here, is that adding the `@pipe` decorator, let's you pass the first argument in a pipe form, so, let's do that:
```python
@pipe
def sum(elements):
    result = 0
	
	for element in elements:
	    result += element
		
	return result
```
After adding the decorator, you may now use both forms of calling the function, as both will work:
Pipe form:
```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] | sum # 15
```
Normal form:
```
sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # 15
```
And finally, you can enjoy the power of the pipes. Let's see another example, in both forms, let's say I want to sum all of the even numbers in a list:
```python
# We will be using the sum function defined above to save typing.
# So I'll just define the 'even' function.

@pipe
def even(elements):
    return [ element for element in elements if element % 2 == 0 ]
	
# This is how you would call it normally:
sum(even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

# This is how you call it with pipes:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] | even | sum
```
Much easier, isn't it?
